# base16-joe

This contains the [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) templates
to generate color schemes for [Joe's Own Editor](https://sf.net/p/joe-editor).

## Installation

```
mkdir -p ~/.joe/colors
cp colors/*.jcf ~/.joe/colors
```

Or, you can use a [builder such as this one](https://github.com/belak/base16-builder-go)
to generate the templates manually.
